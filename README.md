MakeWaves
=========
MakeWaves is an app for generating regular and random waves with UNH's flap-style wavemaker. The app is still in development.


To-do
-----
  * Figure out why random wave output amplitudes seem to be half what they are compared to Random Seas.
  * Pierson-Moskowitz waves only output ramped section of time series even though buffer size is the same. Fix this. 
  * Calculate limits for random wave parameters based on Random Seas LabVIEW code.
  * Listen to ACS controller for E-stop presses, or better yet hard wire E-stop into digital inputs of NI controller?
  * Properly organize folders of code, resources, etc. 


Dependencies
--------
  * Python 2.7x
  * numpy
  * matplotlib (for testing output of wavetsgen.py)
  * daqmx.py (see misc_python)
  * PyDAQmx
  * timeseries.py (see misc_python)
  * PyQt4
  * NI DAQmx driver
