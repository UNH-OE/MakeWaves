MakeWaves
=========
MakeWaves is an app for generating regular and random waves with UNH's flap-style wavemaker. The app is still in development.


To-do
-----
  * Calculate limits for random wave parameters based on Random Seas LabVIEW code.
    * This will involve checking if the maximum piston stroke is beyond the physical limit.
  * Properly organize folders of code, resources, etc. 
  * Make regular waves in a similar way to random, i.e. use sub-buffers so ramping down can happen more quickly?

Dependencies
--------
  * Python 2.7x
  * numpy
  * matplotlib (for testing output of wavetsgen.py)
  * daqmx.py
  * PyDAQmx
  * PyQt4
  * NI DAQmx driver
