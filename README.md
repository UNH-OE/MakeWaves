MakeWaves
=========
MakeWaves is an app for generating regular and random waves with UNH's flap-style wavemaker. The app is still in development.


To-do
-----
  * Figure out why random wave output amplitudes seem to be half what they are compared to Random Seas.
    * Run through and check all math for random waves again!
  * Calculate limits for random wave parameters based on Random Seas LabVIEW code.
    * This will involve checking if the maximum piston stroke is beyond the physical limit.
  * Listen to ACS controller for E-stop presses, or better yet hard wire E-stop into digital inputs of NI DAQ?
  * Properly organize folders of code, resources, etc. 
  * Put searching for new wave height limits in its own thread so GUI doesn't feel laggy -- maybe not necessary.
  * Make regular waves in a similar way to random, i.e. use sub-buffers so ramping down can happen more quickly. 
  * Implement scale ratio in Pierson-Moskowitz waves. Look in comments of wavetsgen.py for more info.

Dependencies
--------
  * Python 2.7x
  * numpy
  * matplotlib (for testing output of wavetsgen.py)
  * daqmx.py (see misc_python)
  * PyDAQmx
  * timeseries.py (see misc_python)
  * PyQt4
  * NI DAQmx driver
