MakeWaves
=========
MakeWaves is an app for generating regular and random waves with UNH's flap-style wavemaker. The app is still in development.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/petebachant/MakeWaves/wiki#wiki-contributing).

### To-do ###
  * Calculate safe limits for random wave parameters based on Random Seas LabVIEW code.
    This will involve checking if the maximum piston stroke is beyond the physical limit.
  * Confirm mathematical accuracy of voltage time series generation in `wavetsgen.py` compared with `Random Seas.vi`.
  * Generate higher order regular (Stokes) waves?

Dependencies
--------
  * Python 2.7
  * Numpy
  * matplotlib (for testing output of wavetsgen.py)
  * [daqmx](http://github.com/petebachant/daqmx.git)
  * [PyDAQmx](http://github.com/clade/PyDAQmx.git)
  * PyQt4
  * NI DAQmx driver
